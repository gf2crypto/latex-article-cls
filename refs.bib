    abstract = {Computer science uses pseudo-random sequences on a daily basis. They are used in games, in network communication protocols, and above all in cryptographic protocols. Number theory is the basis for the majority of pseudo-random generators. In this paper, we propose a new construction of pseudo random generator. This generator is based on the syndrome decoding problem of the rational binary Goppa code. The parameters of the code are generated randomly. The generator is proven secure, effective and simple to implement. it provides an alternative to the theory of numbers and is distinguished by its good performance.},
